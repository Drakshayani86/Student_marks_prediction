# Student_marks_prediction

Student Marks Prediction is a Data Science Project. Here I have used the Linear Regression algorithm to predict the percentage of marks that the student is expected to get based on the number of hours they have studied. I have taken the student marks data set. Later I have applied the Data Cleaning process like replacing null values with the mean value. To train the model I have divided the data into two parts they are test and train. I have also implemented data visualization by using the plot method.
